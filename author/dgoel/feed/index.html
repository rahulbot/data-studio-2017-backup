Our audience are the adult commuters &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/gogreenboston2030-margaret-yu-tina-quach-divya-goel/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">#GoGreenBoston2030 &#8211;  Margaret Yu, Tina Quach, Divya Goel</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In approaching this data log, I first tried to think about what qualifies as data “created by me.” I decided that this data would have to be recorded as a result of my activities, or continuously in the background regardless of my actions (i.e. apps collecting background information). 12 am: Pay for dinner Order recorded in restaurant system &#38; credit card transaction recorded by restaurant as well as my bank 1:30 am – 7 am: &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/14/divyas-data-log-21217/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Divya’s Data Log – 2/12/17</span></a>]]></description>

In learning more about political issues and this process, I’ve turned to fivethirtyeight, as they often have amazing interactive graphics and aggregate data from many different resources &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/09/what-would-it-take-to-turn-bluered-states-redblue/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">What Would It Take To Turn Blue/Red States Red/Blue?</span></a>]]></description>
