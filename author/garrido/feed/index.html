				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi and Miguel Garrido For several decades, motor vehicles have been a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollution in the US. According to the EPA, in 2015 the transportation sector accounted for about 27 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions, second only to the electricity sector. Scientists have long emphasized the adverse effects of vehicle emissions, since GHG emissions cause global warming and drive climate change. Accordingly, U.S. public policy &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/18/ecorace-how-a-board-game-can-influence-eco-friendly-car-purchases/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">EcoRace: How a Board Game Can Influence Eco-Friendly Car Purchases</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, and Lawrence Sun For several years now, the goal of stopping the planet from warming an additional two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels has dominated international climate talks. According to scientific projections, a “no action scenario” may lead to 4.5C of warming by 2100, so it is imperative to pursue the under-2C path by the end of the century. With climate change, a few degrees can make a significant difference. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/marching-for-a-better-tomorrow/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Marching for a Better Tomorrow</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, and Willie Zhu In 2016, MIT celebrated 100 years in Cambridge. As the Institute reflected on this milestone, it also touted its bold initiatives for the 21st century and beyond. By most accounts, MIT’s second century in Cambridge will be even brighter than the first. However, there is one aspect of MIT’s future that is less promising: its home (Cambridge, MA) could face calamitous consequences from climate change in the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/could-mit-be-partly-underwater-by-the-end-of-the-century/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Could MIT Be Partly Underwater by the End of the Century?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, Autumn Jing, and Tony Zeng Most geographic comparisons of carbon dioxide emissions are based on the countries and regions where the pollution occurs. Hence, an integral part of the current debate about the blame and responsibility for climate change focuses on the emission rates of different sovereign states and geopolitical entities. The U.S. and the European Union, for example, have placed more blame on China in recent years since its &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/09/the-hidden-emissions-of-major-polluters/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Hidden Emissions of Major Polluters</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The internet is littered with poor data presentations on climate change. The storytelling in the charts is often ineffective, and the connection to human activity is often absent. In many cases, the “so what?” and the “call to action” are missing from these data presentations. One example of the effective presentation of data is a new tool by the World Bank to rate sustainable energy policies in more than 100 countries. Referred to as “RISE” &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/23/exploring-sustainable-energy-policies-around-the-world/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Exploring Sustainable Energy Policies Around the World</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In this day and age, it is very difficult to go through one’s daily routine in a networked economy without generating digital data in some way. Indeed, you almost have to go out of your way to consciously avoid certain activities, tasks, and behaviors that are routinely tracked and captured in digital form. The following activity log illustrates both the frequency and breadth of the data that I generated in a single day. 7AM: Wake &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/23/data-log-221-a-day-observing-my-data/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data Log 2/21: A Day Observing My Data</span></a>]]></description>
