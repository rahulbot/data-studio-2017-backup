				<description><![CDATA[Team: Autumn Jing / Brandon Levy / Christian Feld / Kevin Zhang We explored MASIE-NH which stands for the Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent – Northern Hemisphere. The data says that the Arctic is in peril as the ice cover has shrunk significantly over the last decade. We want to tell this story because losing the Arctic sea ice will result in very real consequences, from an increased number of life-threatening severe weather events to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/the-arctic-in-limbo/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Arctic In Limbo</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Meghan Kokoski, Mikayla Murphy, Kimberly Yu, Kevin Zhang The Beijing air quality data shows that there was a drastic increase in air quality during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. We wanted to tell this story because although Beijing normally has poor and sometimes even dangerous air quality, they were able to increase air quality to safe levels while hosting the Olympic Games. This change did not occur naturally and was a direct result of government &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/the-olympic-reduction/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Olympic Reduction</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[See our presentation here! Sharlene Chiu, Margaret Tian, Kevin Zhang According to a 1994 study of air pollution removal by trees in urban areas, trees only remove 0.09% of fine particulate matter. This amounts to every tree absorbing about 8 lbs annually, based on the 1995 New York City Tree Census. At first glance, 8 lbs may seem negligible, but we were excited to discover that 7.6 lives are saved each year, thanks to the removal of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/08/trees-saving-lives-in-nyc/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Trees: Saving Lives in NYC</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Source: Energy Production &#38; Changing Energy Sources The &#8220;Our World In Data&#8221; website provides a visualization of global energy production over the past two centuries. The data is broken down into specific energy sources and shows how their composition has changed over the years as the primary energy source transitioned from &#8220;Biofuels&#8221; in the 19th century to &#8220;Crude Oil&#8221; for much of the 20th century. This chart shows how our energy production has changed over &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/08/energy-production/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Energy Production</span></a>]]></description>
