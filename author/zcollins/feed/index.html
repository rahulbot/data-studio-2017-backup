				<description><![CDATA[Sharlene Chiu, Lawrence Sun, Tricia Shi, and Zachary Collins &#160; Methodology For our final project, we iterated on the participatory game sketch the “Amazing Race,” changing the name to “Itinerarie.” The data shows that personal vehicles produce a large amount of carbon emissions. Choosing public transportation or other more environmentally friendly modes of transportation can have a major impact on air pollution. Convenience, time and cost are factors that make picking the “greenest” forms of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/18/itinerarie/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Itinerarie</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Sharlene Chiu, Tricia Shi and Zachary Collins The data says that bees are dying and colonies in many areas are declining in size. We wanted to tell this story because we believe that, although many people know bee populations have been declining, they are unaware of what they can do to help stop it. Our audience are flower shoppers. Many varieties of flowers offer a means for bees to collect the nectar they use as &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/04/buzz-about-bees/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Buzz About Bees</span></a>]]></description>

Many people, due to a societal expectation to be able to provide for themselves and their family, feel too ashamed to reach out for help when they struggle to make ends meet.     The Greater Boston Area has many shelters, food pantries, and churches that &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/464/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Food Insecurity Posters</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Steps to a Better Environment Tricia Shi, Nina Lutz, Sharlene Chiu, and Zachary Collins The data says that our collective mindset towards the environment will have a serious impact on how global carbon emissions will trend over the next few decades. If we take care of the environment, they can level off somewhere very near our current rate. If we don’t, they are expected to increase quite rapidly.

We saw these two developments as very related issues, even if not necessarily correlated.
