				<description><![CDATA[Niki Waghani, Divya Goel, Krithi Looking at the most recent Carbon Dioxide emissions statistics from 2017, we noticed that the top 5 most industrial countries &#8211; the United States, Germany, Japan, China, and the United Knigdom &#8211; collectively produced more emissions than the rest of the countries on the list combined. The sheer size of the disproportionate impact these five countries demonstrates a blatant lack of concern for the environment. We were shocked, so we decided &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/emissions-and-the-top-5-countries/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Emissions and the Top 5 Countries</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, and Willie Zhu In 2016, MIT celebrated 100 years in Cambridge. As the Institute reflected on this milestone, it also touted its bold initiatives for the 21st century and beyond. By most accounts, MIT’s second century in Cambridge will be even brighter than the first. However, there is one aspect of MIT’s future that is less promising: its home (Cambridge, MA) could face calamitous consequences from climate change in the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/could-mit-be-partly-underwater-by-the-end-of-the-century/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Could MIT Be Partly Underwater by the End of the Century?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Erick Friis, Sam Resnick, and Sean Soni The data say that Hubway is often used for short rides of a few miles or less.  We want to tell this story because we think people don’t realize that taking these short trips can prevent CO2 emissions and have a meaningful impact on climate change.  Our audience is college students, specifically MIT students, and as such we have designed our data sculpture around MIT.  We want &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/float-away-with-hubway/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Float Away with Hubway</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tina Quach, Margaret Tian, Tony Zeng, Aina Martinez Zurita In starting this project, we were initially motivated by the data set collected by the US State Department on the Air Quality Readings in Beijing. While the city is commonly known for it’s bad air quality, we were interested in understanding how the air pollution in Beijing compares with other cities around the world, as well as with the accepted health standards.

				<description><![CDATA[Meghan Kokoski, Mikayla Murphy, Kimberly Yu, Kevin Zhang The Beijing air quality data shows that there was a drastic increase in air quality during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. We wanted to tell this story because although Beijing normally has poor and sometimes even dangerous air quality, they were able to increase air quality to safe levels while hosting the Olympic Games. This change did not occur naturally and was a direct result of government &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/23/the-olympic-reduction/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Olympic Reduction</span></a>]]></description>

If we take care of the environment, they can level off somewhere very near our current rate. If we don’t, they are expected to increase quite rapidly.
