				<description><![CDATA[by Margaret Tian, Tony Zeng, Tina Quach, Willie Zhu The data says that sea ice cover in the Arctic is declining year-over-year. Declining sea ice is a major factor in the decline in polar bear populations because they primarily hunt on the ice. Thus, melting ice caps reduce polar bears’ ability to feed themselves and raise their children. From 2001 to 2010, polar bear populations have dropped by 40%. We want to tell this story because &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/polar-bear-and-glaciers-seal-your-survival/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Polar Bear and Glaciers: Seal Your Survival</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team members: Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, Lawrence Sun, Kimberly Yu The data say that different car models have different fuel economy levels, and the driving speed also affects how fuel efficient the car is. We want to tell this story because fuel efficiency is determined by so much more than just the type of car you drive. Most people are aware that certain cars (e.g. Prius) are more fuel-efficient than other cars (e.g. Ford). However, &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/race-for-fuel-efficiency/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Race for Fuel Efficiency</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team: Almaha Almalki, Mikayla Murphy, Ashley Wang, and Jingxian Zhang The dataset we focused on was the US Fuel Economy Measurements. We noticed that fuel economy is not only related to vehicle classes but also to drivers’ driving habits, and found a list of tips and trips to improve fuel efficiency. We hope to tell a story about how driving habits and advanced vehicle technologies can improve fuel efficiency. Our target audience are car owners &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/driver-personality-quiz/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Driver Personality Quiz</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Global warming is inevitable, but if we play the game right, the results won&#8217;t be as catastrophic. My data game is a modified version of Jenga. There are 3 stakeholders; environmentalists (pink pieces), politicians (green pieces), and human factors (representing fossil fuel companies, etc) . While staying in the confines of their roles, the players want to prevent the tower from falling as long as possible. Player rules&#8230; Each round, the factors player must remove any tile. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/global-warming-jenga-participatory-game/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Global Warming Jenga Participatory Game</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Erick Friis, Krithi Chandrakasan, Aina Martinez Zurita, Sam Resnick The US fuel economy measurement dataset shows many surprising and non intuitive values for different car models. We want to tell this story, because we believe there is a disparity between perceived and actual fuel economy among car owners. For our participatory data game we designed an interactive visual game on a mall display board that allows users to guess the relative efficiency of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/guess-your-green/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Guess Your Green</span></a>]]></description>

The data says that the Arctic is in peril as the ice cover has shrunk significantly over the last decade.

				<description><![CDATA[Zach Collins, Divya Goel, Meghan Kokoski, Tricia Shi For our participatory data game, we envisioned a Bluetooth &#8211; enabled mobile game that aims to demonstrate the impact that individual transportation decisions have on the environment. The Bluetooth aspect allows you to connect your results to the other MIT players, and show how transportation decisions, when considered collectively, have an even more significant impact.
