				<description><![CDATA[The Arctic Ice Project by Aina Martinez Zurita / Christian Feld / Kevin Zhang / Lawrence Sun We worked with the “Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent &#8211; Northern Hemisphere” data set. The data shows that the ice cover is in the shrinking over time. We want to tell the story of what consequences this might have for the animals living in the Northern Hemisphere and for our own lives. &#160; The data not only provides &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/04/the-arctic-ice-project/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Arctic Ice Project</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Erick Friis, Krithi Chandrakasan, Sam Resnick, Willy Zhu The USDA bee colony datasets show an alarming decrease in honey production by state between the years 2000 and 2016. The one exception to this trend is North Dakota, which remains the final safe haven for bees.  However, due to destruction of habitat through increased pesticide use and decrease in conservation efforts, this last home for the American honey bee is being destroyed.

				<description><![CDATA[Sharlene Chiu, Tricia Shi and Zachary Collins The data says that bees are dying and colonies in many areas are declining in size. We wanted to tell this story because we believe that, although many people know bee populations have been declining, they are unaware of what they can do to help stop it. Our audience are flower shoppers. Many varieties of flowers offer a means for bees to collect the nectar they use as &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/04/buzz-about-bees/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Buzz About Bees</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Home Sweet Home Ashley Wang, Kimberly Yu, Margaret Yu The data say that honey consumption in the U.S. is increasing, but the yield per bee colony is declining in the U.S. We want to tell this story because bees are very important for the pollination of approximately one third of the United States&#8217; crop species, including a variety of fruits and nuts.
