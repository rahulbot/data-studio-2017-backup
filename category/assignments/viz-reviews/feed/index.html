				<description><![CDATA[I was reading about the recent selling of IPv4 addresses by MIT to Amazon and in some of the discussion a rather old but classic data visualization popped up: This is, of course, the xkcd &#8220;map of the internet&#8221;. The data that is being shown is which entities own certain IP address ranges: essentially blocks of the internet. For example, in the data visualization we see that MIT owns IP prefixes that start with 18. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/02/a-map-of-the-internet/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A Map of the Internet</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[I chose to review a data infographic about the very popular and delicious Girl Scout cookies. Anyone who is a fan of these cookies would enjoy this infographic. It doesn’t have an agenda or stance but rather just provides lots of fun facts and history. The end goal is to build interest. The infographic is long, so I’ve clipped out the best parts. The image above appears at the top of the infographic.

				<description><![CDATA[The internet is littered with poor data presentations on climate change. The storytelling in the charts is often ineffective, and the connection to human activity is often absent. In many cases, the “so what?” and the “call to action” are missing from these data presentations. One example of the effective presentation of data is a new tool by the World Bank to rate sustainable energy policies in more than 100 countries. Referred to as “RISE” &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/23/exploring-sustainable-energy-policies-around-the-world/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Exploring Sustainable Energy Policies Around the World</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Source: https://www.givedirectly.org/ In the field of development economics there are two main points of view on how to most effectively lift poor people out of poverty.  One school of thought is that the only way to help them is to give them access to resources like livestock, housing, food, etc.  Another more controversial point of view is that the most efficient way of helping them is to give cash directly to them and allow them to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/15/givedirectly-send-money-directly-to-people-living-in-extreme-poverty/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">GiveDirectly &#8211; send money directly to people living in extreme poverty</span></a>]]></description>

It contains a massive amount of information, but still presents a relatively simple narrative of the wonder of space exploration. This poster lays out information about all of NASA’s space missions from 1959 to 2015. On the top half, the flight paths are shown in thin lines, recording which celestial bodies the spaceship orbited.

				<description><![CDATA[Google searches on the universal topic of food can tell a very interesting story about food trends. I recently came across The Rhythm of Food, a collaborative effort between Google News Lab and Truth &#38; Beauty to explore patterns in food trends based on Google searches over the years starting from 2004.  The one-page website provides a scrollable, rather adventurous experience of viewing food trends, starting with the rise and fall of certain diets, cuisines, and recipes between &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/12/the-rhythm-of-food/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Rhythm of Food</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[I’m from Southern California, and one of the biggest issues in the state recently has been the drought. This series of 259 drought maps shows the drought level in the state of California from December 2011 to February 2017. At the top of the visualization is a legend assigning a color to different drought levels: The drought maps are then displayed chronologically in a grid, left to right and top to bottom.

All these questions and more can be answered through an interactive visualization platform called &#8220;Is it illegal to Drive ..?&#8220;. The platform uses a nice map to provide the answer to the most-Googled questions about driving laws in the US. It is developed by Just Park to show the inconsistencies in U.S. driving laws.

				<description><![CDATA[A while ago I came across this chart by Randall Moore, the creator of the webcomic XKCD. The chart aims at representing the average ionazing radiation dose due to different sources. As explained in the top of the chart, the radiation dose is measured in sieverts (Sv). The sources reported range from regular activities, such as airplane flights or medical procedures, to doses due to carastrophic events such as Fukushima and Chernovyl. The main objective &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/02/10/radiation-chart/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Radiation Chart</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What makes data presentations really powerful, is when users are not only passive consumers. I recently found a striking example for that. It´s a New York Times article called “You Draw It: What Got Better or Worse During Obama’s Presidency”. It shows how indicators of key policy issues developed during the Obama years: e.g. national debt, unemployment rate, number of crimes or troops abroad. Readers are shown the data for the Bush years (2000-2008).
