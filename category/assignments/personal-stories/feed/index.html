				<description><![CDATA[By Krithi Chandrakasan, Sharlene Chiu, and Willie Zhu The Go Boston 2030 initiative reached out to members of the community to gather their questions about the urban transportation system of tomorrow. While responders were typically curious about congestion and flying cars, the most memorable piece of information from the dataset was a comment about the Go Boston 2030 initiative itself. &#8220;Resident #engagement at its best, in my hometown!&#8221; a local Bostonian told the surveyors.  We decided to create an interactive game that tells the story &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/13/community-engagement/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Community Engagement</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team: Almaha Almalki / Christian Feld / Erick Friis / Sam Resnick The Food for Free dataset leads us to three interesting conclusions: The sheer amount of food that is produced, stored, and then subsequently dumped in the Boston area alone is massive. The Food for Free organisation is creating a large impact by simply rerouting that food to become meals for the hungry Still, so many more people in the Boston area suffer from &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/rescue-food-provide-meals/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Rescue Food, Provide Meals</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, and Lawrence Sun For several years now, the goal of stopping the planet from warming an additional two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels has dominated international climate talks. According to scientific projections, a “no action scenario” may lead to 4.5C of warming by 2100, so it is imperative to pursue the under-2C path by the end of the century. With climate change, a few degrees can make a significant difference. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/marching-for-a-better-tomorrow/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Marching for a Better Tomorrow</span></a>]]></description>

Many people in the US rely on food assistance programs (ex: SNAP) to meet their day to day needs &#8211; over half a million people are on SNAP in Massachusetts alone. SNAP recipients are given roughly $1.50 to spend on each meal, which means they often forego more expensive fresh produce. Programs such as Project Bread bridge the hunger gap by providing healthy, inexpensive food &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/healthy-eating-for-everyone/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Healthy Eating for Everyone</span></a>]]></description>

With all these inspiring ideas and questions, suppose there is a GoBoston 2030 Civil Engineering Hackathon to encourage young innovators to explore future transportation in Boston.

Many people, due to a societal expectation to be able to provide for themselves and their family, feel too ashamed to reach out for help when they struggle to make ends meet.     The Greater Boston Area has many shelters, food pantries, and churches that &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/11/464/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Food Insecurity Posters</span></a>]]></description>
