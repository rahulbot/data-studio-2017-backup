				<description><![CDATA[Untitled drawing (1) The data say planting trees has a measurable impact on a city, in human health and economic benefit. We want to tell this story because planting trees relies on people going outside and volunteering, and the first step to increasing public participation is education. I pulled most of my data from NYC&#8217;s MillionTreesNYC initiative, using the 1995 and 2015 tree datasets. I compared the population of trees, dividing the data by which &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/16/one-million-roots/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">One Million Roots</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Almaha Almalki, Krithi Chandrakasan, Erick Friis, Aina Martinez Zurita Our analysis of data in the World Bank CO2 emissions dataset showed a clear increase in the level of emissions around the world between the years 1990 and 2013. During this time frame worldwide emissions doubled with five countries responsible for over half of total global emissions. Additionally, to highlight the real impact of these rising emissions on society we integrated data showing a &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/09/the-choking-effects-of-co2/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Choking Effects of CO2</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Are You A Pollution Champion? Find Out! Team: Nina Lutz / Nikita Waghani / Christian Feld We worked with the World Bank dataset showing CO2 emissions on a country-by-country basis for the years 1990, 2000, 2007-2013. There are plenty of possibilities to analyze the data. If for example you look at the ranking of countries with the highest pollution over time, you see how China overtakes the US, because more and more industrial production is &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/09/375/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text"></span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi, Miguel Garrido, Autumn Jing, and Tony Zeng Most geographic comparisons of carbon dioxide emissions are based on the countries and regions where the pollution occurs. Hence, an integral part of the current debate about the blame and responsibility for climate change focuses on the emission rates of different sovereign states and geopolitical entities. The U.S. and the European Union, for example, have placed more blame on China in recent years since its &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/09/the-hidden-emissions-of-major-polluters/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Hidden Emissions of Major Polluters</span></a>]]></description>

This number has only increased throughout the years, even outpacing the average rate of increase. We want to tell this story to find out why people would continue planting these stinky trees, and what makes them so popular.

				<description><![CDATA[See our presentation here! Sharlene Chiu, Margaret Tian, Kevin Zhang According to a 1994 study of air pollution removal by trees in urban areas, trees only remove 0.09% of fine particulate matter. This amounts to every tree absorbing about 8 lbs annually, based on the 1995 New York City Tree Census. At first glance, 8 lbs may seem negligible, but we were excited to discover that 7.6 lives are saved each year, thanks to the removal of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/03/08/trees-saving-lives-in-nyc/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Trees: Saving Lives in NYC</span></a>]]></description>
