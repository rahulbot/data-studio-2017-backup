				<description><![CDATA[By Paul Choi and Miguel Garrido For several decades, motor vehicles have been a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollution in the US. According to the EPA, in 2015 the transportation sector accounted for about 27 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions, second only to the electricity sector. Scientists have long emphasized the adverse effects of vehicle emissions, since GHG emissions cause global warming and drive climate change. Accordingly, U.S. public policy &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/18/ecorace-how-a-board-game-can-influence-eco-friendly-car-purchases/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">EcoRace: How a Board Game Can Influence Eco-Friendly Car Purchases</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Meghan Kokoski, Mikayla Murphy, Kimberly Yu, and Margaret Yu Methodology The main data source we used was the Hubway trips dataset, which contains the start station, end station, timings, and other information for every Hubway ride ever taken. Early on, we identified that our primary audience was MIT students without a Hubway membership, and that our goal was to encourage these students to purchase annual Hubway memberships. To achieve this goal, we created a &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/18/hubway-class-of-2017-final-project/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Hubway Class of 2017: Final Project</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Sharlene Chiu, Lawrence Sun, Tricia Shi, and Zachary Collins &#160; Methodology For our final project, we iterated on the participatory game sketch the “Amazing Race,” changing the name to “Itinerarie.” The data shows that personal vehicles produce a large amount of carbon emissions. Choosing public transportation or other more environmentally friendly modes of transportation can have a major impact on air pollution. Convenience, time and cost are factors that make picking the “greenest” forms of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/05/18/itinerarie/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Itinerarie</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[by Margaret Tian, Tina Quach, Tony Zeng, Willie Zhu Intro Our project was a physical board game titled “Polar Bears: Seal Your Survival” that aimed to teach kids about the impact of global warming on the Arctic. We focused on making the game engaging, by emphasizing interactivity. The board game format is well-suited for kids, because the short play sessions are able to hold their attention, while still teaching them about global warming.

We want to tell this story, because we believe there is a disparity between perceived and actual fuel economy among car owners. For our participatory data game we designed an interactive visual game on a mall display board that allows users to guess the relative efficiency of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2017.datatherapy.org/2017/04/25/guess-your-green/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Guess Your Green</span></a>]]></description>
